                    JavaScript is a programming language that is primarily used
                    to create interactive and dynamic web pages, as well as
                    other network-based applications. It is a client-side
                    scripting language, which means that it runs on the user's
                    browser rather than on a server. JavaScript is often used in
                    conjunction with HTML and CSS to create responsive and
                    interactive websites. It is also commonly used to create
                    browser extensions and web-based games.

                    JavaScript is a programming language that runs primarily on
                    the client-side (i.e. in the user's web browser) but can
                    also be run on the server-side using Node.js. It is often
                    used to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces,
                    validate user input, and communicate with servers through
                    APIs. JavaScript code is written in plain text and can be
                    integrated with HTML and CSS to create web pages. When a
                    user requests a web page, the browser downloads the HTML,
                    CSS, and JavaScript files and runs the JavaScript code to
                    create the dynamic behavior of the page.
                  </p>

                  <p class="mb-5">
                    For example, a JavaScript code can be used to validate an
                    email address input field before it is submitted. Or it can
                    be used to make a request to the server to load some data
                    and then updating the page with that data without refreshing
                    the page.

                  <p class="mb-5">
                    JavaScript code can be integrated into an HTML document
                    using the &#60;script&#62; tag. It can also be included in
                    separate .js files and linked to the HTML document.

                What is Variable in javascript?

                    In JavaScript, a variable is a named storage location for a
                    value. Variables allow you to store and manipulate data in
                    your program. You can assign a value to a variable using the
                    assignment operator (=), and then reference the variable by
                    its name to access its value.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-5">
                    JavaScript variables are declared using the var, let, or
                    const keyword, followed by the variable name. For example:
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-5 bg-gray-900 text-white p-4 rounded">
                    var x; <br />
                    let y; <br />
                    const z = "hello";
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-5 bg-gray-900 text-white p-4 rounded">
                    x = 5; <br />
                    y = "hello";
                  </p>
                  <p class="bg-gray-900 text-white p-4 rounded">
                    console.log(x); // Output: 5 <br />
                    console.log(y); // Output: "hello" <br />
                    console.log(z); // Output: "hello"
                  </p>

                    var a = 10; // declares a variable named a and assigns it

                    In JavaScript, there are several types of variables,
                    including:

                  <ul class="list-disc mb-3 pl-8">
                    <li>Number: a numeric value (e.g. 1, 3.14, -10)</li>
                    <li>
                      String: a sequence of characters (e.g. "hello", "world")
                    </li>
                    <li>Boolean: a true or false value</li>
                    <li>Object: a collection of key-value pairs</li>
                    <li>Array: a collection of ordered values</li>
                    <li>Function: a block of code that can be executed</li>
                    <li>Symbol: a unique and immutable data type</li>
                    <li>
                      undefined: a variable that has been declared but has not
                      been assigned a value

                    You can find out the type of a variable in JavaScript using
                    the typeof operator. The typeof operator returns a string
                    indicating the type of the operand. Here are some examples

                    let y = "hello";<br />
                    console.log(typeof y); // Output: "string"<br /><br />

                    let z = true;<br />
                    console.log(typeof z); // Output: "boolean"<br /><br />

                    console.log(typeof a); // Output: "object"<br /><br />

                    let b = [1, 2, 3];<br />

                    A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as
                    a given condition is true. A for loop, on the other hand,
                    iterates over a sequence of values (such as a list or
                    string) and executes a block of code for each value in the
                    sequence. In other words, a while loop is used to execute a
                    block of code based on a condition, while a for loop is used
                    to iterate over a sequence of values.

                    JavaScript is a programming language that is primarily used
                    to create interactive and dynamic web pages, as well as
                    other network-based applications. It is a client-side
                    scripting language, which means that it runs on the user's
                    browser rather than on a server. JavaScript is often used in
                    conjunction with HTML and CSS to create responsive and
                    interactive websites. It is also commonly used to create
                    browser extensions and web-based games.
