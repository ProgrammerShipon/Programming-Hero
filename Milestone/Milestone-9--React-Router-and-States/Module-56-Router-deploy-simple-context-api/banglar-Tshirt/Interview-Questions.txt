/**
 *       CUSTOM HOOK 
 * A custom Hook has following features: 
 *  # As a function, it takes input and returns output.
 *  # Its name starts with use like useQuery, useMedia
 *  # Unlike functional components, custom hooks can use other hooks such as useState, useRef... and other custom hooks
 */

/**
 *    Why and When to USE React CUSTOM HOOKS?
 * Completely separate logic from user interface.
 * Reusable in many different components with the same processing logic Therefore, the logic only needs to be fixed in one place if it changes.
 * When the logic is too long and complicated, we can write it in another file, so that the component is shorter and easier to read.
