Não há melhor do que acordar de manhã e ao virar da esquina estar a ribeira do Porto."

The flat was as described, neat and tidy. The weather was quite cold, but thankfully A&G left us with extra blankets and electric heaters to use. Location was great. Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on. This may also have been down to the very wet weather we had while there. All in all, very happy and would definitely recommend."

Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen. "

There were tons of restaurants close to the apartment and it was a quick walk across the bridge to tour the Port wineries. Be forewarned; if you are looking for a very quiet location, this area may not be for you. However, if you are looking to step outside of your door and start enjoying what Porto has to offer, I recommend this location."

There is NO HEATING in any of the rooms and living room, only bed covers (not nordic duvet) and small heaters which you have to switch off during the night. Those were not enough during our stay in January even we had sunny days! Moreover we were 5 people in the house without NO HOT WATER enough for all of us. \nThe pictures did not show the reality. Furniture was much older and WiFi signal is only available in the living room, not the rooms.\nOn the other hand, location is great if you want to stay close to the river. Although think about that all restaurants, bars and main tourist attractions are close to Train Station and Clerigos Tower which means 15-20 min uphill walking distance from the house."

In less than 10 minutes u’re in Vila Nova De Gaia where u can find the wineries of porto’s wine.\nThe apartment is really spacious and comfortable, perfect for 7 italian people that want to have fun in Oporto.\nSuggested!!!"

But in warmer months Im sure this isn't an issue.\nThe beds are a little hard with one slightly out of shape,  and the shower is fairly basic (hand held) but does the job. Because of the central location some noise can be expected early in the mornings. \nOverall the apartment suited our needs for our short stay and the price is more than reasonable for what we got."

The house was perfectly clean and the easily able to accommodate 6 people despite only having one bathroom. The beds and living room were comfortable. \n\nHowever, we always felt somewhat on edge in the house due to the number of signs posted around the kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom about being charged 15€ for all sorts of extras like not washing up or using extra towels and bed linen. Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \n\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it."

        "comments": "This is everything we expected and hoped for in a sub-$100/night condo stay in Waikiki. This definitely isn't the Ritz, and if you're looking for a luxury get-away, you're barking up the wrong tree. However, if you're like we were: first time visitors on a budget with humble taste, then this place is perfect. The location is a tiny bit removed from the touristy Beachwalk shopping area, but not so far as to preclude you from limbering up for a spirited walk over there. And by the marina, you're actually quite close to the Ala Moana mall. So, the location is good. The place itself is a modest studio setup, but perfectly adequate with a good sized bed for a couple, enough space for your luggage, and a kitchenette and bathroom that though tight, is perfectly fine. There's also cable and internet if you're looking for homey creature comforts. It was also fantastic to have a free parking space included, an air conditioning wall unit, and the panoramic window view was pretty cool, though you only really get a peak of the beach. Also, David was very good about staying in contact with us the day we arrived to get acclimated, and we did not have further occasion to require his services the rest of our stay, so our contact was minimal, but satisfactory ... no problem there. The minor quibbles we had were pretty thin walls, so we would often hear the murmur of the neighbors' TVs. Also, there seemed to be two elevators working the entire building, so they could take quite a while to pop up. Again though, if you're like us, your #1 priorities are spend a minimal amount of time in your room, get out to experience Hawaii, come back to a sanitary place to sleep at night, all while staying within a reasonable budget. This place fit the bill, and we would recommend it to anyone with the same priorities."

        "comments": "If you're looking to spend most of your time in Hawaii outside (and not inside your room or your hotel, like with the Waikiki resort complexes) then this apartment will do the trick. It's definitely not luxurious but has the basics and is in a great location. It fits 2 people but more would be cramped. \nYou can hit the beach in as little as 5 mns walking or get to central Waikiki beach in 15-20 mns walking.  It's also easy to catch a bus to visit something outside Waikiki. There is a convenience store nearby, as well as several breakfast and restaurant options. The apartment has a small kitchen with cooking utensils but we ended up mostly eating dinners out. \nDavid was courteous and likely very knowledgeable about the area but we didn't ask him for suggestions, we ended up just using our guide book. \nOverall if you want to experience Waikiki without spending a fortune or being pampered, this is a great option. Mahalo David!"

        "comments": "Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The condo is in a great location if you want to be in or near Waikiki and Ala Moana. It's a small studio, and not luxurious, but great if you want a functional, reasonably comfortable and very affordable base for exploring Oahu. The parking space is wonderful if you rent a car, as otherwise you're looking at an additional $15-$20 a day. The building is right on Ala Moana Blvd so it's noisy if you keep the windows open, but that's also true of many high-price Waikiki hotel rooms. Air conditioning is a bit noisy; I slept with earplugs but my boyfriend didn't need them (I'm a light sleeper and use them at home). The condo has a full size fridge, small cooktop, microwave, coffee maker, coffee press, beach chairs, some knackered beach mats, towels, pots, plates, etc.. Wifi is a plus. The bathroom appears quite recently updated, and though small is nice - great shower. \r\n\r\nCons: There's no lanai and the view is very partial, but to us those were small things. Elevators were sometimes very slow and occasionally out of commission, which was a hassle and a bit concerning.\r\n\r\nWe never actually met David. All was handled by text and email. He instructed us to get someone to let us in to the building, which seemed a bit dodgy, but in the end it was no problem, and he said to call if there was any issue. Condo door was unlocked and keys were on the table.\r\n\r\nI would consider staying here again if I plan to stay in the Waikiki vicinity. \r\n\r\n"

It's close to Waikiki and the downtown area but not in the thick of things so if you're looking to avoid the 24/7 hustle and bustle then this might work for you. There is a basic kitchenette and eating area. Accessories for enjoying the sand and surf are available for use, pool, and hot tub as well, and secure parking which is a plus.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for expansive ocean views, a room to hang out and relax in with up to date decor, and where you can easily meet and get to know people staying in the complex then this wouldn't be for you. The dependability of the elevators, particularly during high winds, is a bit of a concern.\r\n\r\nI never met David, things were handled via airbnb email. I spoke with him on the phone when my plans changed and he was flexible in changing the dates of the original reservation.\r\n"

The secure parking, cable tv and air conditioning unit were a bonus, as was the view! The unit was in a prime location, close to Waikiki and Ala Moana, and really convenient to locate. David was easy to reach and the check-in / check-out process was easy. The unit is also close to major highways so it is easy to get on/off hwy 1. \r\n\r\nBoth elevators were down at one point during our stay, but it wasn't a problem - walking up/down was easy (we didn't have anything to carry) and one elevator was fixed by the time we got back in the evening. \r\n\r\nDavid, thank you for the stay - it was great!

The location of the unit is perfect - walking distance from all the Wakiki beaches, restaurants, shops, and ABC stores. \r\n\r\nThe unit itself was a bit run-down. The cabinets and doors felt like they needed an update and the bed wasn't the most comfortable. The elevator in the building (our unit was on the 16th floor) was painfully slow but that's no fault of David's. \r\n\r\nAll in all, this was a great move over a hotel or something and the price is great."

We followed the instruction to get the key and found our parking spot without any problem. The location of the apartment is also very convenient. A few blocks to the beach and choices of restaurants near by. There are less tourists in this part of the town, so it's more quite and less crowded"

All of this for under $110/night, I couldn't have asked for more.  If ever back in Oahu, I'll be sure to reach out to David again."

As a former 5-year resident of Honolulu I can attest that this building is conveniently located at the entrance of Waikiki close to the Ala Moana Shopping Center and Ala Moana Beach.  This was my very first experience ever using Airbnb so I didn't really know what to expect.  I travel to Honolulu 4 times a year and always stay in a hotel, but my cousin recommended I try Airbnb as a less expensive alternative.  I had some technical issues when I first checked into the studio getting the window A/C unit (A/C remote I believe had dead batteries) and cable TV to work (T/V HDMI input wrong) but with David conveniently living in the building, he was quick to remedy the situation.

Parking is difficult to come by in Waikiki and when available will run you at least $25 a day so this condo is a bargain.  Lockbox made for easy check-in/check-out.  Elevators in this tower are iffy but at least one of the two elevators was working during our stay so not a problem.  David was great and yes, the next time we need to visit Waikiki, we’ll book the apt. again."

Bus 20 or the trolley was easy to access from the main road and a lot of eating places nearby. The weather was a nice 27 deg with a few showers from time to time and the Circle Island tour from Roberts or  any other tour guide was around $35  and  was worth the price. "

On oublie rapidement le côté un peu vétuste de l'immeuble et le bruit de la clim (qui fonctionne très bien pour refroidir la chambre cela dit) en appréciant :\r\n- La propreté du logement\r\n- La vue sur le port et l'océan \r\n- Tout est fonctionnel, et il y a même quelques objets utiles en plus comme une glacière souple que nous avons pu utiliser pour la plage\r\n- La piscine et le jacuzzi\r\n- La place de parking réservée pour nous\r\n- La rapidité de David pour répondre à nos questions\r\n- La petite supérette ABC store juste au coin de la rue qui dépanne bien en cas de besoin.\r\n\r\nSi nous avons la chance de revenir un jour à Hawaï, ce pourrait être dans ce même logement avec plaisir !\r\n\r\nMahalo :) "

Parking is included which is not so common for most listing. \n\nApartment is simple and cosy. All basic necessities are provided. Feels like home right away. We got lucky with the elevators (unlike most reviews) as both elevators were operating during most part of our stay. \n\nWe had a bathroom crisis in the middle of the night when the flushing tank overflowed and almost flooded. Luckily David took care of it right away in the morning and even cleaned up the affected. \n\n"

Spent 9 days on Oahu to attend a conference and visit family. If you're looking for a no frills, small but clean place to stay where you can save a few $$ by cooking and warming local meals easily in the mini kitchen and walking to the Hilton Hawaiian Village (.8 mi.) this is the place for you. Elevator was a bit slow so if you have to be somewhere on time you'll need to allow maybe 10-15 additional min. A/C worked but slow upon startup but who cares if you're enjoying the outdoors and rarely in the room? Ran into David in the lobby just before checking out--he is kind and lovely! Would stay here again."

The one working elevator was broken half the time and incredibly slow the other half. Instead of waiting 30+ minutes (not exaggerating), we went up and down 16 flights of stairs. I felt awful for those on higher floors.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly not David's fault, but I hope it is fixed soon. It's ridiculous."

The apartment is good size for two people and very clean, the linens are of good quality and ample, and the kitchen is well equipped.  Of note are the windows which span 18 feet to provide good natural lighting, a partial view of the marina and ocean front, and good ventilation (we never used the A/C).  We were impressed with the location – walking distance to the hotel beaches, the Fort Derussy military facilities, Ala Moana Park and Shopping Mall, public transportation, restaurants, and convenience stores.  The elevator service for the 40 story/140 unit building  is an ongoing problem, with only one ten-person lift  operating “in slow mode for  safety” or not at all if winds are high.  You'll certainly need patience when gaining access to the apartment and possibly physical endurance to negotiate the stairs (we only had to climb the stairs 3 times in 2 weeks)."

The mall is just down the street or you could walk there, free parking at the mall if you do drive. Down the street on Kalakaua is Luxury Row. The world’s top fashion houses—Tiffany & Co., Coach, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Gucci, Tod’s, Bottega Veneta and Hugo Boss it was fun to go in the shops. Having a free parking space is a bonus. The view of the marina and ocean was beautiful. I could see boats headed out to sea and parasailers. Laundry located on the 5th floor along with the ice machine if you're headed out for the day a small cooler was provided. Vending machines are on the 2nd floor or you can walk to the ABC store at the corner. Bed was soft and comfortable. Air-conditioner works perfectly or you can open the window for an ocean breeze. Great pressure in the shower and plenty of towels. If you want to eat in there is a microwave, stove and fridge. During busy times you may have to wait for the elevator, only 1 is working, but there are stairs."

I feel like with the $75 cleaning fee, they needed to do a much better job. The TV had no reception so we weren’t able to use it. The mattress was pretty hard to sleep on. Although we were aware of the elevator issues, the wait for the elevator took up to 15 mins at times.\n\nWas located in a very nice location, close to everything. You could walk everywhere. The host was very nice and contacted us before arrival and before leaving.\n\nOverall, if you’re looking for a comfortable stay, I would suggest going to a hotel."

        "comments": "This rental was the first time I’ve rented lodging from Airbnb. \n\nI’m giving the review three stars instead of one star because of two reasons, \nDavid, the property manager, and the location, in Waikiki. \n\nDavid is a very nice man who listened to our concerns and acted to help out as much as he could.  David responded usually within two hours.  We were disappointed with the rental but David worked with us to adjust the rental fees.\n\nThe biggest issue we saw was that the condo was dirty.  With a cleaning fee of $100 and the nice pictures on the Airbnb website, we expected a mostly dust free and clean rental.  We talked with David about the dirty items (there were many) and a couple missing items.  He was apologetic and did his best to help salvage our stay. \n\nWe ended up leaving before the end of the rental agreement and David worked with us on that.  After our stay, David messaged me to say that the items I told him were all addressed.  I would recommend that the next renter message David and verify.\n\nBecause of the location, the free parking, and David, I would rent the condo again."

We experienced a elevators failure during Christmas holidays, so no maintenance was available for few days. The apt is on the 16th floor so climbing the stairs (small ramps of 7 steps each though) at least twice a day was quite annoying. The host offered spontanusly 255€ refund for the inconvenience."

The apartment was clean and large and in a wonderful neighborhood. She had lists and menus of places to eat. I couldn't have been happier with our arrangement. Thanks Greta!"

It was an easy 3 minute walk and be on your way to anywhere in NY. \r\nThe shower is something else, the best water pressure I have experienced in a long time.\r\nI thought the decor was cool and eclectic, Greta must have an artistic streak. The Murphy bed was comfortable, and the AC unit (not pictured) kept it nice and cool.  \r\nAlthough I didn't meet her, she arranged for a neighbor to meet me and show me in. He was cool and so were any other neighbors that I met. \r\nShe also left a list of suggestions where to shop and eat, along with menus which was helpful when I needed a late night meal. \r\nHighly recommended. \r\n"

There was even a binder with additional information like places to eat and places to go.  She even took the time to make sure we knew how to use the radiator!  Being from Hawaii, we had no knowledge about radiators and how to use them - we really appreciated her thoughtfulness!"

I would describe the apartment as a very warm, personal, comfortable and homey place to stay. It’s a corner apartment with good light, lots of books and  very good energy. Plus, the beds are quite comfortable. My daughter exclaimed “Hey Dad, come lie down in this one. You’ll never want to get up!”\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was incredibly well located and enjoyable. The train stops  a half block away, and there are numerous excellent restaurants and conveniences close by. Greta, the host, provides a first-rate list of recommendations.\r\n\r\nGreta was a personable, helpful and extremely welcoming host. She was very quick to respond to my online inquiries and, once we arrived, to any further requests for advice.\r\n"

We were two of us and only used one room, but the house can fit another person or two. \r\nFor anyone visiting NYC and looking to be in the city but not in the midst of the city noise, this is a great place to stay! You can be downtown in 20 minutes. "

The Murphy (fold-down) bed has a very thick memory foam mattress that is extremely comfortable.  Samantha (the cat) was a sweet little presence, but she kept mostly to herself so we barely saw her.  The location is great, less than a block to the 1 line, and there are several nice restaurants in the neighborhood.  Finally, Greta herself was a perfect host:  kind but not intrusive, thoughtful in her preparations for guests, and available should any problems arise (though none did).  A great airbnb experience!"

I requested her a really early check in and she agreed (which was helpful because I took a red eye from Seattle). She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\r\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\r\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn't use). Safe building with elevator. \r\n\r\nI would totally stay here again.  "

Her apt is located close to all amenities, Central and Riverside Parks, and bus/subway stops. The apt is clean, more spacious than expected, well stocked with anything you could possibly need, and has very comfortable beds and a first rate shower. I was travelling with my soon-to-be 17 year old daughter so she was thrilled to have her own bedroom! This is not fancy accommodation but warm and homey and probably a good representation of how an average New Yorker lives, although I suspect not many are as organized as Greta. Much recommended!"

Her recommendations are outstanding and the check-in and check-out were  extremely easy.  This is a five star host and you won't go wrong with this choice for a stay in NYC. \r\n"

There is a subway on the same street as the apartment, a two minute walk away (the 1 line) and multiple places to eat close by. There is also a CVS , Walgreens, grocery and liquor store within walking distance as well. The apartment is very clean and the bed is very comfortable. Checking in and out as easy as Greta is very flexible. The apartment is very spacious with a nice kitchen and lots of room in the fridge. I hope to continue to stay here every time I visit New York!

The flat itself is a true newyorker's one, warm, stylish and excellentlty connected with the subway. We strongly suggest it for everyone!"

The subway entrance close to the apartment was manned and easy to buy and top up your pass, it is the only way to travel around the city. On leaving for the airport, after both our stays we had only to wait a minute on the corner with our luggage to get a taxi to the airport. Once again Greta allowed us to arrive and leave at times that suited us with our luggage which didn't leave us stranded for hours with difficult flight times from Australia which was a great relief, thanks so much Greta!"

We took Lyft around due to my mom's use of a wheelchair in the streets. Drivers made good time to and from lower Manhattan via larger roads. Elevator made it easy to get to and from the 4th floor apartment, and being on the 4th floor removed us from the street a bit. "

I even walked to Leblon from there in under 40 minutes. \n\nThe hosts met me up front and helped me with my luggage. They don't speak English, but are very charming and helpful, so we communicated via (Hidden by Airbnb) Translate, using (Hidden by Airbnb) .\n\nThe building is slightly older. One day there was no water in the building due to maintenance. The hosts warned me about this, there was nothing they could do and I was prepared. Only issue is that after the water came back, because of the older pipes, it was brown for a little while, just have to let the taps run for several minutes. \n\nThe bed isn't the most comfortable for an extended stay (I was there for eight nights), but for short durations it's fine. \n\nThere is a washing machine in the apartment, it works great, I dried my clothes by hanging them on chairs, hooks, etc. \n\nThe WiFi is strong and reliable. \n\nThere is a grocery store and a couple of reasonably priced restaurants on the block, as well as two different banks. Excellent for visitors. A drug store is also available on the next block at the corner. \n\nOverall the inconveniences were small and the positives of this location was great. "

Al lado de la puerta de entrada había un supermercado con buenos precios y hay muchas tiendas de diferentes tipos alrededor.\r\nEl departamento es tal cual se ve en las fotos, muy acogedor y para nada caluroso. Hay un ventilador de techo en el living para la cama que está allí y un ventilador y aire acondicionado para la cama de dos plazas en la habitación. El departamento estaba muy limpio apenas llegamos, con todo en su lugar. Teníamos todo a nuestra disposición, todo bien ordenado.\r\nValeria nos recibió en la entrada y nos entregó las llaves en mano, nos explicó todo paso a paso del departamento. Su llavero tenía una tarjeta de descuento para el supermercado, ella nos lo prestó y nos sirvió mucho para hacer las compras. Valeria fue de gran ayuda en todo momento. Previo a llegar se contactó conmigo, también durante la estadía por si necesitábamos algo y previo a nuestra partida. Cuando la contactábamos, teníamos respuesta rápida. Eso nos hizo sentir muy cómodos y nos ayudó.\r\nTanto el departamento como la anfitriona hicieron que tuvieramos una gran estadía en Copacabana."

A dos cuadras está el hotel Atlantis... donde compré 3 tours a : Angra do Reis/Isla Grande, Búzios y uno a Cabo do Reis... todos excelentes 200 reales por persona. Recomiendo un restaurante a 2 cuadras del depto de Valeria se llama Eclipse... ricas pizas a 12,5 reales... hamburguesas con papa a 18 reales... carnes con agregados(picaña) a 33 reales... muy rico y buen precio. Valeria una excelente anfitriona, muy confiable. Uber funciona sin problema. Lo pasamos increíble."

Tem tudo o que é preciso para uma boa estadia, como utensílios de cozinha e roupas de cama e banho! Os banheiros estavam extremamente limpos, a recepção e a comunicação foi ótima! Além disso, é preciso destacar a localização, bem próxima às praias de Copacabana e Ipanema, e de estar no mesmo quarteirão de lanchonete, padaria, restaurante, supermercado, farmácia e bancos! Super indico e com certeza voltaria a me hospedar lá."

Wir wurden sehr herzlich begrüsst! Der Standort ist perfekt, da der Strand von Copacabana (ca.3 Min.) so wie die Ipanema (ca.10Min) zu Fuss zu erreiche sind. Zudem ist ein Supermarkt direkt neben dem Eingang! Wir haben uns auch Nachts sicher gefühlt und würden die Unterkunft herzlichst weiter empfehlen."

Ana Valeria is a sweet and considerate host. \n\nI would not call the apartment luxurious, but it has everything you need and it’s clean. A small kitchen, and laundry is a must for me. If you’re like me, and you love Rio, and go to the beach everyday, there is no better location. I can hop on a skateboard and get to Leme or leblon, no prob. \n\nI won’t say more, so when I want to book again it will be available!!\n\nThank you Ana Valeria. Beijão, amiga."

The flat is light and spacious, kitchen well-equipped, bed comfortable (both beds actually), and bathroom clean, with great shower pressure. Zeynep prepared a note with key information about the flat, which was great to have for reference. I especially appreciated the ground coffee and coffee maker. The fact that there was a desk in the house made my stay all the more comfortable - I had a proper place to sit down at my computer.\r\n\r\nIt's clear that Zeynep has put a lot of care into making her flat a home - it's an awesome flat! \r\n\r\nZeynep lives a five min walk to the sea, with a great park along the water front. There are plenty of hip cafes and coffee shops in the neighborhood (Moda), all a short walk from the flat. And it's only a 15 mins walk to the Kadikoy ferry, which offers easy access to the rest of Istanbul."

O bairro do Catete tem uma localização boa, conseguimos ir para a Lapa à pé e também para outros lugares como o aterro e a praia do Flamengo durante o carnaval. A estação de metrô também é perto e tem várias opções de alimentação muito próximas à casa. O layout da casa assemelha-se à um hostel, o quarto que eu fiquei tem tamanho excelente para 4 pessoas e tem ar condicionado, o que faz muita diferença com o calor que está no Rio de Janeiro. Existem 4 banheiros, que são suficientes para o número de pessoas que cabem na casa, entretanto durante todos os dias que passei lá, o banheiro não foi limpo nenhuma vez, por sorte os hóspedes estavam mantendo-o em condições de uso, mas seria importante limpar o banheiro de vez em quando. \r\nOutro ponto importante é que os quartos são ligados por uma porta que não tem fechadura e é bem fina, ou seja, a privacidade não é garantida e o barulho de um quarto pode ser ouvido perfeitamente no outro.\r\nO preço é justo pelo que é oferecido, seria importante apenas melhorar a limpeza e verificar se é possível fechar a comunicação dos quartos."
